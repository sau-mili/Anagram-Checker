# Anagram-Checker
This repository contains a simple yet effective Anagram Checker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to input two strings and check if they are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
